# Microsoft Program Synthesis using Examples SDK

The Program Synthesis using Examples (PROSE) SDK includes a set of technologies for the automatic generation of programs from input-output examples. This repo includes samples and sample data for the Microsoft PROSE SDK.

The samples are split into three categories:

* Data wrangling samples in [WranglingSamples.sln](WranglingSamples.sln). This sample shows how to use the PROSE Data Wrangling API.  
* Program synthesis samples in [ProseSamples.sln](ProseSamples.sln). This sample shows how to instantiate the framework to build a synthesizer for a new DSL. 
* PROSE DSL authoring Tutorial in [DslAuthoringTutorial](DslAuthoringTutorial). This sample demonstrates in a step-by-step manner how to instantiate the framework to build a synthesizer for a new DSL. It is mainly used during PROSE workshops.
